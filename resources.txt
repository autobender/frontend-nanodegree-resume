Have used mostly the resources found in the course. Which include jQuery API doc, 
Google Map API doc. Also used the recommended validators.
Have also read some other documents:

After reading through the Google Maps API i couldn't figure out how to get more
interesting mapsInfo. Once i sent arguments into service.textSearch i couldn't
figure out how to get for example bio.name into the mapInfo, with the correct
location.
